MATLAB code files for MPhil examiners

Apologies if this is still empty, I intend to propagate this as soon as possible, and before the viva.

It is all written in MATLAB, apologies if you don't read MATLAB, but you should, it's great!!

The order of scripts is as follows:

time_function_1b_overnight_interp_2point2_221_viva

Exp_4c_D_LDS_FS_latch_pt2_version_d_221_edit_viva

class_2p2_viva

I will clean it up soon, still lots of commented out code

Hope you enjoy it.
